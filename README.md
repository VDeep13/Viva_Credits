## Overview

This repository contains analysis and visualization of viva (oral exam) credits/marks data using Jupyter Notebook. The project is designed to explore and summarize student performance, trends, and possible correlations using standard data science tools.

## Main Files

- **Viva_Credits.ipynb** (or similarly named notebook):  
  The primary Jupyter Notebook with all steps for loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the viva credits data.
- **CSV dataset file(s)**:  
  Data files containing student viva credits/marks and related attributes.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VDeep13/Viva_Credits.git
   cd Viva_Credits
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   Make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open `Viva_Credits.ipynb` (or the main notebook file).

4. **Run the notebook**
   - Execute each cell in order to load the data, perform cleaning, analysis, and view visualizations.
   - You can modify or extend the code for your own exploration or reporting.

## Typical Analysis Steps

- Data loading and initial exploration
- Data cleaning (handling missing values, formatting, etc.)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with summary statistics and plots
- Visualizations to understand trends, distributions, and relationships
- Optional: Statistical analysis or predictive modeling
